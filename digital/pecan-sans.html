          <h2>
            An alphabet made out of pecans. 
            In such a scenario, in order to use a typeface for typical use on a site for body copy you would need at least four files.
          </h2>

          <p>
            With a variable font, all of those permutations can be contained in a single file. That file would be larger than a single font, but in most cases smaller or about the same size as the 4 you might load for body copy. The advantage in choosing the variable font is that you have access to the entire range of weights, widths, and styles available, rather than being constrained to only the few that you previously would have loaded separately.
