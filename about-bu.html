        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am from Austin, TX, I love to build random things, 
            make music, and play soccer and tennis. I am a sophomore 
            (Class of 2023) studying architecture and design at MIT 
            and I am also interested in mechanical engineering, product 
            design, and computational design. I am passionate about finding 
            ways in which creative design can positively impact people and 
            their surroundings. 
            <br><br>
            Some of my skills include experience with Rhino, Grasshopper, 
            Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I also have experience 
            coding in Python, JavaScript, and HMTL/CSS. I am fluent in Spanish 
            and am currently learning Italian.
