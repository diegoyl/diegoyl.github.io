        Hi, my name is Diego.
        <br><br>I am from Austin, TX and a sophomore 
        (Class of 2023) studying architecture at MIT.
        I love to build random things, make music, and play soccer and tennis. 
        I am also interested in mechanical engineering, 
        product design, and computational design. 
        I am passionate about finding ways in which creative design 
        can positively impact people and their surroundings. 
        <br><br>
        Some of my skills include experience with Rhino, Grasshopper, 
        Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I also have experience 
        coding in Python, JavaScript, and HMTL/CSS. I am fluent in Spanish 
        and am currently learning Italian.
        <br><br>
