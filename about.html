            Hi, I'm Diego.
            <br><br>I'm from Austin, TX and I like to build things, 
            make music, and play soccer and tennis.
            I'm a sophomore (Class of 2023) studying architecture at MIT and 
            I'm also interested in mechanical engineering, 
            product design, and computational design. 
            <!-- I am passionate about finding ways in which creative design 
            can positively impact people and their surroundings.  -->
            <br><br>
            Some of my skills include Rhino, Grasshopper, 
            Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I also have experience 
            coding in Python, JavaScript, and HMTL/CSS. I am fluent in Spanish 
            and am currently learning Italian!
            <br><br>     
            
            <!-- I love listening to music and also making it. I play guitar and trumpet and I also play in a band which you can check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diegoatethedrummer/" target="_blank">here</a> -->
